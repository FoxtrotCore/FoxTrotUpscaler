<body><h1>Preferences</h1><h2>Overview</h2><p style="margin-left: 40px;">You
can change how FTU works to an extent, as well as activate some nifty
features in this tab. This section will go over all of this.</p><h2>Options</h2><h3>Dependency File Paths</h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;">You
can change the file paths of the 4 dependencies used by
FoxTrotUpscaler. The window will also show the current path, if you
need to navigate to the programs. There are buttons to open the
websites of the required programs, if needed. RawTherapee has a special
check box, since the program is completely optional, to decide if you
want to include RawTherapee as part of the upscaling process.</p><h3>Intermediary Image File Format</h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;">You can pick to have the pictures in the 3 frame folders, to either be PNG's or Uncompressed TIFF's.<br>PNG's are smaller compressed files, and are a little slower to upscale with.<br>Uncompressed TIFF's will not compress the image, and are faster in upscaling, but will require more disk space.<br><span style="color: red;">Storage size, must be taken in consideration, as the problem of a couple of bytes can be compounded 30,000 times.</span></p><h3>Shutdown on Process Completion</h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;">FTU
at the end of a queue, or single process, can shutdown the computer to
save energy. Shutdown will happen after uploading is completed, so you
wont have to turn the computer on right away, if everything was
successful. Otherwise, it can be set to stay on.</p><h3>Overwrite ANY data if Required</h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;">This
is a safety mechanism in place to prevent the loss of work. It can be
very easy to accidentally type in the episode number of an episode
already upscaled, or lose frames in the 3 frame folders. Having this
enabled will attempt to analyze every expected file name before
anything starts, so you can decide what to do. This is so you don't come
back to the computer the next day to find out it only worked for one
hour and stopped to ask you a question. <span style="color: red;"><br>Overwrite
Checks are only done when a process is executed, if a file is added
during execution, they will be overwritten without warning.<br>The
only files that will be overwritten no matter what this setting says,
are images in the 3 frame files when doing a NORMAL upscale.</span> The manual upscale script will still check these folders if this mechanism is enabled.</p><h3>FTUServerBot Settings</h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;">This feature has its own section dedicated to it,&nbsp;please refer to that.</p><h3>WebDAV Upload</h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;">This feature has its own section dedicated to it,&nbsp;please refer to that.</p><h2>Engaging Changes</h2><p style="margin-left: 40px;">You
are free to look and make changes to the Preferences only while FTU is
idle. Making a change will lock the user in that tab, and
require&nbsp;Saving the changes, or Reverting them, to leave the
Preferences tab. You can also reset FTU, which will delete the saved
data, and close FTU.<br><span style="color: red;">Changes made to settings affect all processes in queue, not just ones queued with the new settings.</span></p></body></html>
