<h1>File System</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Starting FTU for the first
time, will generate a bunch of Folders and a few files. All of the work
done by FTU will be done in these folders, so you should become
knowledgeable about them. Some will be more useful then others. This
section will explain each of them, as well as detail the expected file
names, for files in the said folders.<br><span style="color: red;">Note,
if a &lt;&gt; has number signs in them, it signified how many
chars/digits are required for that section, no more, no less.</span><br>All LANGs refer to a standarized 3 digit ISO 639-2/B language code, see here for the entire list: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes</a></p>
<h2>Commonly Accessed Folders</h2>
<h3>/Export</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">This folder is where all of the completed upscaled videos will
go.This is also where Videos still in the process of Stage D, or videos
that were aborted in Stage D are.This is where Re-muxed Videos
will go on completion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Completed Upscales: <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-style: italic;">"Upscaled_&lt;LANG
###&gt;_&lt;EP
###&gt;_&lt;SHOWNAME&gt;.&lt;EXTENSION&gt;"</span></li>
<li>Completed Re-muxes: <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-style: italic;">"Remuxed_&lt;LANG

<li>Incomplete/Aborted Videos:<span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-style: italic;"> "&lt;EP
###&gt;_&lt;SHOWNAME&gt;.&lt;EXTENSION&gt;"</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>/ImportVideo</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">This folder is where you put
all of the videos that are to be Upscaled, or videos to be de-interlaced
before hand.</p>
<ul>
<li>Interlaced Videos: <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-style: italic;">"Interlaced_&lt;EP
###&gt;_&lt;SHOWNAME&gt;.&lt;EXTENSION&gt;"</span></li>
<li>Input Video: <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-style: italic;">"Input_&lt;EP
###&gt;_&lt;SHOWNAME&gt;.&lt;EXTENSION&gt;"</span></li>
</ul><h3>/ImportAudio &amp; /ImportSubtitles</h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;">These
folders are where you put either all of your subtitles, or audio to be
muxed together with the export video. The Stream Extraction Script will
put files here&nbsp;on completion.</p><ul><li>Audio Files: <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-style: italic;">"&lt;LANG
###&gt;_&lt;EP
###&gt;_&lt;SHOWNAME&gt;.&lt;EXTENSION&gt;"</span></li><li>Subtitle Files: <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-style: italic;">"&lt;LANG
###&gt;_&lt;EP
###&gt;_&lt;SHOWNAME&gt;.&lt;EXTENSION&gt;"</span></li></ul><h2>Rarely Accessed Folders</h2><h3>/QueuedFrames &amp; /IntermediateFrames &amp; /ProcessedFrames</h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;">These folders are used by FTU to store all of the frames it is manipulating. <span style="color: red;">You will need to inspect these folders when using the Manual Upscale Script</span><br>Frames derived from Stage A, will go in /QueuedFrames<br>Frames created from Stage B, will go in either /IntermediateFrames if RawTherapee is used, or /ProcessedFrames if not<br>Frames created from Stage C, will go in /ProcessedFrames</p><ul><li>Frames: <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-style: italic;">"OEP######.&lt;EXTENSION&gt;"</span></li></ul><h3>/Queue</h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;">This folder is where all of the Upscale Processes are saved to disk. <span style="color: red;">This folder should not be tampered with.</span></p><ul><li>Process Serializations: <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-style: italic;">"Q###.ser"</span></li></ul><h3>/Temp</h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;">This
folder stores logs, and the preferences for FTU. FTU logs its own
activities in foxtrot.log. Every time the program runs, FTU's log is
rolled over. These&nbsp;log's are necessary when filing bug reports.
Please only upload the logs in question, do not upload logs unrelated
to any issues. foxtrot.log is the latest log, while foxtrot-1.log is
the second latest, and so on. Another file will be GlobalData.ser,
which stores all the preferences in FTU. Deleting this will reset FTU
as if being freshly installed. The last file should be log.txt, which
is a log used by Stage D. <br><span style="color: red;">None of these files should be deleted, only the logs should be shared with the developer, could hold sensitive information.</span></p><ul><li>FTU logs: <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-style: italic;">"foxtrot-#.log"</span></li><li>FTU Saved Data: <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-style: italic;">"GlobalData.ser"</span></li><li>FFMPEG log: <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-style: italic;">"log.log"</span></li></ul><h2>Individual Files</h2><h3>config.txt</h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;">This text file is so important and essential, it has its own section in the documentation, please refer to that.</p><h3>rawTherapee.pp3</h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;">If
you want to run Stage C, this file will be necessary, otherwise Stage C
will be skipped. This file tells RawTherapee exactly what to do with
each frame, before the frames are compressed together into a video.
Must be generated by actually opening RawTherapee, and generating a
.pp3 file in there.</p><h3>running</h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Helps
prevent running multiple instances of FTU from running at the same
time. Only delete if FTU claims to be running already when it is not.</p>
