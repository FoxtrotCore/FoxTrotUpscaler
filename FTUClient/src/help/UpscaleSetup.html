<body><h1>Upscale Setup - Main Function</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This is the main function of FoxTrotUpscaler, where you are able to
upscale groups of videos hopefully without issue. The top half is where
you input what files to use, some meta data, and convenience options.
The bottom half provides feedback on whats going on, reports potential
problems and errors, as well as holds the the almighty progress bars.</p>
<h2>How to Start a Process</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pick or type in the name of the show. <br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">If you don't see your show name in the list, that should be a warning FTU can't find it.</span></li>
<li>Type in the episode number of the video, audio, and subtitles you plan to use.</li>
<li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">The next block of options are for muxing Audio and Subtitles, which can be ignored if you only care about the video.<br><span style="color: red;">FTU
will Not take the Audio and Subtitle Streams from the souce video in
/ImportVideo, they must be manually extracted and placed in
/ImportAudio and /ImportSubtitles. More information on how to do this
can be found in the QuickScripts section.</span></span>
<ol>
<li>Activate the check mark if you want FTU to Add a Audio/Subtitle Stream into the final product.</li>
<li>Specify the language of the stream.</li>
<li>Pick or type in a title for the stream.</li>
<li>If you need to offset the stream in relation to the video, enter a time-code here.<br>A Positive time code will delay the audio, negative (should) pull the audio forward.<br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">A red box around the Offset box indicates bad syntax. Double click the check mark to reset the box to 00</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Optionally, you can enter a meta data Title and Description for the final product, VLC and Kodi should notice it.</span></li>
<li>Pick the Export container format you want.<br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Changing
container from MKV may not support all features of FTU or certain
FFMPEG commands, please verify all encoders, meta data entries, and
file types are compatible with each other.</span></li>
<li>Duration and Master Offset: you can choose to upscale only a
certain section of a video without being forced to cut a chunk of the
video out externally.<br>Start with changing the Master Offset time
code, to where you want to start upscaling from, and the Duration time
code, to how much time in the video you want to upscale for.<br><span style="color: black;">Ex.</span> Master Offset: 00:00:10.000 will start upscaling from the 10 second mark<br><span style="color: black;">Ex.</span> Duration: 00:01:00.000 will upscale for 1 minute of the video duration<br>Both put together would upscale starting from the 10 second mark, for one minute of the video duration<br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Both are dependent on the input frame rate given in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">config.txt</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Optionally, if you want to
enable RawTherapee, place a "RawTherapee.pp3" file named exactly as
such, in the same folder as the jar.</span> If you press the yellow button, and it finds the file, it will turn green.<br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">If the button is gray, you have RawTherapee disabled in the preferences, refer to that section to enable it.</span></li>
<li>Now decide which Stage you want to start from.<br>All upscales
start from Stage A (SA), but if FTU got shutdown, then
couldn't/wouldn't activate the recovery, you can start from any of the
4 stages assuming the previous one completed successfully.<br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">This option is ignored if you Save Configuration to Disk, instead of beginning immediately</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, all the required information is entered, and your ready to
start upscaling. You can choose to save this "Process" in a queue, or
execute this Process immediately. If you want to schedule multiple
videos together, go to Save for Queue. If you just have one video for
now, then got to Execute Immediately</p>
<ul>
<li>Save for Queue:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Press Save for Queue<br>If the verification completes, the
Configuration will be saved to disk, and the option to Start the Queue
will be available if you didn't already have other Processes saved.</li>
<li>Now you can redo Steps 1-7 for the next video you have planned to upscale, and save it to disk.</li>
<li>You can completely delete the queue if needed. In future updates,
you will have a pop up window to manage the Queue more directly.</li>
<li>After you have queued all your videos, pressing "Start Queue" will begin the Process.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Execute Immediately:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Press Execute, thats it.<br>If the verification checks out, it will begin the Process.</li>
</ol><p><span style="color: red;">When all the progress bars are indeterminate, that means verification is still on going. Please be patient.</span><br>If a verification fails for a certain reason, you will get a dialog box explaining the issue, and possible solutions.<br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Most verification errors stem from incorrectly labeled files, complete lack of files, or syntax errors in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">config.txt</span>.&nbsp;</span><br>(Errors from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">config.txt</span> are addressed in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">config.txt</span> section)</p>
<h2>Controls during a Upscale</h2>
<p>After a upscale begins, you will have 2 to 3 buttons for freezing the upscale.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pause/Resume: Kills the currently running Process, and saves required data to resume from a couple frames before.<br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Only
functions as advertised on Stage B and C, Stages A and D can not be
resumed when paused, and will start over that stage from 0%.</span></li>
<li>
<p>Abort/Full Abort: Kills the currently running Stage, and the entire
Process. If an episode is queued after the one that was canceled,
(Single) Abort will move on to the next video. Otherwise, Abort/Full
Abort both stop all Upscaling activity.<br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">If
Abort buttons are used, or FTU is closed and your computer is locked
up, the Upscaling may still be going. Use command prompt to kill
""ffmpeg", "ffprobe", "waifu2x-caffe-cui", or "rawtherapee-cli".</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Recovery: Its possible for your computer to behave strangely while
upscaling, and FTU may be terminated, or your whole computer can crash.
It would then be frustrating to figure out what needs to be done to
resume the upscale; but FTU can, most of the time, detect that it was
interrupted, and offer to pick up where it left off, even in a queue. <br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">But
when offered, if you decline to recover, FTU will not ask again about
recovering that specific Process instance, it will be lost!<br>If a
process encounters a problem while in a queue, the error will be
logged, but the next Process in the queue will begin immediately. All
progress made on that Process will be deleted to make room for the next
one.<br></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Information Logged</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">It can be helpful to analyze the
performance of a computer upscaling, and compare the results with
either different upscaling parameters in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">config.txt</span>,
or on completely different systems. FTU has a couple tools right now to
assist with this, along with more, planned in future updates.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Progress Bars: 5 progress bars might seem excessive, but help
visualize the progress of the upscale as a whole. The first 3 bars are
measured every so often, by counting the number of frames in their
respective folders. The 4th bar scans output from FFMPEG to get the
number of frames. The bars also tell the exact current frame count of
the Stage in question, the total number of expected frames before
completion, and the calculated percentage of completion. The last
progress bar, when needed, keeps track of the upscales in queue, which
shouldn't need much explanation.<br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">In
the uncommon, but possible occurrence of a Stage not reaching the
expected number of frames before completing successfully; FTU will
continue but leave a warning in the Error Console as well append "!!!"
to the Stage's progress bar.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">ETA: This is probably the best
benchmark for quantifying the performance of a computer in upscaling
via Waifu2x. The ETA will keep track of the same frame counts of the
Progress Bars, and over time continue to calculate the expected amount
of time remaining until the <strong>STAGE</strong> completes.<br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">The
ETA is NOT accurate to the second, on the contrary, the seconds counter
just marks when the actual ETA will be updated again, which is every 60
seconds.<br>Do not trust the ETA for production schedules, it is a very
rough estimate with the minimal amount of data available to it, that
does not account for reduced system resources and of course,
terminations/crashes.<br></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Elapsed Time: This marker will
keep track of how much time a upscale takes. Pausing and Resuming the
upscale will pause/resume this timer as well. Time resets to zero if
the next video in a queue begins upscaling.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Output Log: This text area will contain all of the output that the 4 stages produce in CMD.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Error Log: Similar Text Area as Output Log, but contains all the text from the CMD error streams.&nbsp;<br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Both Logs may contain more helpful information in diagnosing bad upscale parameters, or other smaller issues unrelated to FTU.<br>Both Logs limited to the 200 latest lines of text, to allow actual scrolling in the log.</span></span></li>
