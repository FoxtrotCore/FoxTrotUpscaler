<html><head><meta content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1" http-equiv="content-type"><title>WebDAV</title></head><body><h1>WebDAV Upload</h1><h2>Overview</h2><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Go
ahead, show off these upscaled videos to the world! That means though
you need to get them of your computer and on to the Internet. But then
using a queue could force you to wait a couple days before you
interrupt your computer from upscaling. This also assumes you catch
FoxTrotUpscaler just as Stage D finishes, which could be during your
sleep. For this reason, FTU has the ability to upload to a WebDAV
server, immediately after Stage D completes. The upscaling will take a
break for a bit during the upload, but if during a queue, will continue
right on with the next episode after. This section will go over this
feature, and how to set it up.</p><h2>Setup</h2><ol><li>Obtain the necessary credentials for the WebDAV server from its master.</li><li>Open FTU, and go to the Preferences tab</li><li>Press "Enable Uploads" in the WebDAV section</li><li>In the pop-up, enter in the the network address of the folder, enter in your credentials, and press "Verify".</li><li>If
&nbsp;verification is successful, the client will place a text file on
the folder accessed to prove its connection, and where it plans to
upload, and the values will be updated.</li></ol><h2>Usage</h2><p style="margin-left: 40px;">You
wont notice anything different with this enabled until a upscale
reaches Stage D completion. A dialog box will appear letting the user
know it is uploading, with the time elapsed. When completed, the dialog
will close, and the next upscale will begin if in a queue. The
Overwrite safety check also applies here, and will prevent overwriting
on the server. It will however, keep the local copy, since the
overwrite check on Process start, prevented overwriting a local version.<br>A
failed upload will throw an error, but continue the next video if there
is a queue.Credentials for WebDAV server are saved, even on restarting
FTU.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><span style="color: red;">Users agree to accept any risks
