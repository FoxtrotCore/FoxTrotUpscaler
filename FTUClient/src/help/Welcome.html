<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p class="western" style="padding-left: 30px;" align="left">This program is a controller to efficiently use
FFMPEG, Waifu2x-caffe, and RawTherapee together to create a upscaled
video. While you could easily replace the main functionality of this
program with a batch script, it leaves a lot to be desired. Due to the
time consuming nature of this process, this program aims to get started
upscaling quickly, automate the process for multiple queued videos,
provide basic statistics for the speed your computer hardware upscales,
and provide some remote monitoring over your clients. For upscaling
only a video occasionally, this may not feel so useful. For a whole
team attempting to upscale entire TV shows on multiple computers, the
extra tools offered should make a world of a difference.</p><h2>Method Explanation</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FoxTrotUpscaler (FTU)
renders videos in what seems like a extremely inefficient way. However,
on the right videos, it works great, and is completely free. Recent
breakthroughs in Computer Science have created algorithms that are
capable of upscaling video with a reasonable degree of accuracy to a
significantly higher resolution. There is some complex stuff going on
in this process that even I don't quite understand myself, but the
program Waifu2x-caffe, is able to take a photo, and upscale it guessing
a fair bit of detail correctly. But it only is usable on photos, which
is a obviously not video. So FTU uses FFMPEG, to decompress a video
into each of its individual frames, process them all with the
algorithm, and re-compress it all into a video. Also, since you are
going to have all the photos there, the program gives the option to run
the frames through RawTherapee, if you wanted to do some extra general
touch-ups on the frames. Thats it, the video can then be combined with
audio, subtitles, and meta data that the user choses to be included.
This process even with $2000 hardware, can take more then 24 hours
running full blast for just a 30 minute video. This is the main reason
for FTU's existence, not just to make this technology accessible to the
computer illiterate, but to reduce computer idle time to zero, in
between these 3-4 stages.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2>

and "rawTherapee.pp3", creating your custom configuration for a
specific video type will take some testing. You need to change the
values in "config.txt" to match the content you plan to upscale, the
default one is not the best solution. The "config.txt" help section
will explain everything you need to know the file, and what it does,
but the only way to find the right config is through testing. The
Waifu2x-caffe website has recommendations on which settings are
probably best for certain computers and content types, but the guide is
not perfect. It is best to create multiple configs, and upscale the
same video with each of them, and pick which one looks the best. After,
create derivative configs that have the same quality settings, but have
different speed settings, to see how far you can reduce the time
without being unstable, or compromising quality. This will finally get
you to your custom "config.txt" that will work best for your situation.
After, if you want to apply color correction on all of your frames, you
can do so with RawTherapee. You will have to refer to this programs
documentation on how, but you need to generate a .pp3 file, which will
contain all the steps to color correct any input image. You can share
these files with others, and split the workload accordingly. Some
assistance in working with other computers and people can be found with
FTUServerBot. You can read its documentation on Github (eventually).
Now you can make use of FTU, and start upscaling on your own! The rest
of the documentation will teach, on how to use the program.</p><h2>&nbsp;External Links</h2>
