is great on its own, but paired with FTUServerBot, is much more
accessible. You will not always be in attendance of the client computer
while it is upscaling, especially since it requires no human
interaction during an upscale. Babysitting the machine would be boring.
Remote connections could solve this problem, but asking a computer to
do that takes away resources from the upscaling, and begins to risk
affecting the stability of the system. So to solve this problem, A
separate program called FTUServerBot was created as a server for FTU
clients to connect to. &nbsp;When a connection is established, the
client will report all of its activities to the Server, which can
handle multiple clients. The Server also acts as a Discord bot, where
multiple users on a discord server can interface with it to request
data or be notified of events. This section will cover the client side
of this relationship, the server side documentation will be included
with FTUServerBot.</p><h2>Setup</h2><ol><li>Obtain the necessary credentials from the server master</li><li>Go to the Preferences tab in FTU</li><li>Press "Link" in the FTUServerBot section</li><li>Enter in a name for this client instance of FTU, enter the host name, enter the port for the server, and press "Verify".</li><li>If verification is successful, The server will establish a link and and the client will report data automatically. The UI will also update its values.<br><span style="color: red;">The server name will be at the bottom of the ServerBot panel, make sure its the server you intended to connect to.</span></li></ol><h2>Usage</h2><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Every
extra thing FTU does for reporting is intended to be automatic. There
is nothing else the user can tell the client to do regarding
FTUServerBot, other then to disconnect. The connection will
automatically be closed when FTU is closed, and is reestablished when
the program is restarted. <br><span style="color: red;">Deleting "/Temp/GlobalData.ser" will prevent a connection from being made on program start.</span><br>For understanding what is now possible when linked to a server, please check the server documentation.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><span style="color: red;">In a future update, there will be the possibility of the server sending instructions to clients to upscale remotely. If
this occurs, there will also be a toggle to prevent the server from
controlling the client remotely, if the client does not want this
feature. Users agree to accept any risks associated with remote
connections from the network, and will not hold developers accountable
for any damage this may cause</span></strong>.</p></body></html>
