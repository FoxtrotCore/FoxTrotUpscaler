<body><h1 class="western" align="left"><span><strong>Config.txt Usage</strong></span></h1>
<h2><span>Overview</span></h2>
<p class="western" align="left">When you first run FoxTrotUpscaler, it will generate a file called <u>config.txt</u>
in the same folder the Jar file is placed in. It has some extra text
for the user to read, but at its core, its a list of key/value pairs
that the User MUST edit if they want a good upscale. The default values
are supplied so that the program will work, and some you may leave
alone. However, they are all worth looking into, as all the options the
dependencies provide that do not fit the purpose of FTU are hard-coded
anyway. They are listed at the bottom of the <u>config.txt</u> in case
the user wishes to know exactly. If you screw up the syntax, the
program will delete the old one and create a fresh one with the default
values, so don&#8217;t screw it up -<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Eventually rename instead of delete</span></p>
<h2><span>Exceptions</span></h2>
<p class="western" align="left">Almost all of the options require a value, except for </p>
<ol>
<li class="western" align="left">Stage A Input Source Arguments (line 20)</li>
<li class="western" align="left">Stage A Export Arguments (Line 21)</li>
<li class="western" align="left">Stage D Input Source Arguments (line 22)</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="western" align="left"><span>Options</span></h2>
<p class="western" align="left">The entire list of values required can be organized into 3 parts.</p>
<ol>
<li class="western" align="left">Waifu2x-caffe Upscale Parameters</li>
<li class="western" align="left">Video Frame rates</li>
<li class="western" align="left">FFMPEG Arguments</li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Waifu2x-caffe Upscale Parameters</span></h3>
<p class="western" align="left">The First set of values are all
required for Waifu2x (Stage B) to function. The values define how
Waifu2x upscales the content, as well as the resources available to it.
You can find an explanation for all of these parameters on the
developers website: <a class="western" href="https://github.com/lltcggie/waifu2x-caffe"><span><span lang="zxx"><u>https://github.com/lltcggie/waifu2x-caffe</u></span></span></a><span style="color: red;"><br> (Yes, it is in Japanese, but it is understandable with Google Translate)</span></p>
<p class="western" align="left">The First half of the GitHub page
should explain what the options do. Some affect how the upscale is
done, and affect the quality. Other options affect how fast the upscale
happens, which is dependent on your hardware. The Second half will
explain
the syntax for the CUI variant of the software. The command examples
shown are intended to be entered like &#8220;-tta 0&#8221; into CMD, but that is
FTU&#8217;s job, you just have to enter &#8220;0&#8221; in line 15 after the &#8220;&gt;&#8221;
character, to enter the equivalent value.</p>
<h3><span>Video Frame rates</span></h3>
<p class="western" align="left">The Next values are the Import and
Export videos frame rate. Just find the first in VLC, pick the second
and enter them in. Make sure to double check this value every time you
change &#8220;TV show&#8221; or whatever. The reason these values are in the text
file rather then the GUI is that the values are expected to be
consistent for a "group" of videos. So rather then have you enter it in
100 times, just change it in the text file when needed.<br><span style="color: red;">It
is OK, to use multiple versions of a config, in the same queue of
processes. You do not even have to close FTU to make a change in this
file.</span></p>
<h3><span>FFMPEG Arguments</span></h3>
<p class="western" align="left">The Last set of values are the FFMPEG
arguments. These are a lot less like multiple choice questions, and
more like free response. They can be easier to mess up if you are
unfamiliar with FFMPEG. So I suggest you brush up on the documentation,
because this can allow you to use the program more effectively. <a class="western" href="https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html"><span><span lang="zxx"><u>https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html</u></span></span></a></p>
<p class="western" align="left">The 6 Arguments all work in the exact
same way, but apply to different parts of all the Stages that use
FFMPEG. Each of them provide extra/required FFMPEG arguments of your
choosing to the mentioned content that it refers to.<br> For example,
one of the required arguments for &#8220;Stage D Export&#8221; provide a video
encoder and preset to FFMPEG,. In Stage D, the program is converting
individual frames into a video, which is why it requires an encoder, as
it cant just copy the stream.</p>
<p class="western" align="left">However, you could also append to any
of the 6 arguments, other flags that FFMPEG would recognize. This can
allow you to edit the final product an infinite number of ways, without
needing a second pass though FFMPEG or re-encoding. Otherwise, you can
put the bare minimum of the required flags, and for the optional
arguments (the 3 Exceptions above) , leave them blank.</p>
<p class="western" align="left">Just beware that FTU will not confirm
any of the content in the Arguments, and assume you at least put the
required parameters. If it crashes due to User error in the config.txt,
FFMPEG should tell you what it did not like in the Console Area, so you
can fix it. <span style="color: red;">Any further help with this should be directed to FFMPEG&#8217;s documentation.</span></p></body></html>
